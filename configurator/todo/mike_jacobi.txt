57	Trace Viewer Screen
	UI sub-todos:
		Minor resize issues:
			column sizing does not get triggered?
			detail lbox update does not get triggered
			remember selected row?
		Scroll to bottom if at bottom before an update
		Drop down column type
	Next todos:
		Change input data to JSON format and parse it.

X	1-9, 11-12, 14-17, 20-22, 25, 27, 29-32
X	10 grid ordering (all grids except ordered ones (includes screens' included grids))
X	13 SQL queries on draw finish
X	34 apply changes made in LOT #9, #11 to all relevant screens
X	37 change delete multiple to use 1 sql statement; this will allow one error message 
		when 1 or more rows cannot be deleted (DELETE FROM Asterisk.v_routes WHERE route_name='ld10' error)
X	38 fix bug where a TableForm's grid cannot be added to when it is empty
X	14 remove cos_id from extensions (once Mark gives ok)
X	24 Details -> reload voicemail grid on voicemail change
X	43 cos dropdown on extensions screen		
X	26 switch main detail grids to use custom db types
		(revamp NVGrid to support mixed init from both Program Data and DB in a single Grid)
X	45 immediate cell edit (both textbox and combo)
X	46 tableform's grid autosizing (just autosize, don't expand to full width if not needed)
X	47 optimize getNextAvailableUniqueId() /// @todo find a better way to do this (1 sql transaction)
X	49 logViewer: refresh on resize
X	40 fix bug where Delete Selected button sometimes does nothing (delete keyboard key still works fine)
X	41 Uprade Timing class to keep a stack of Timers
X	52 Confirmation yes/no popup on delete row(s)
X	51 DB Protocol Version check
X	33 fix error in code found by Nick (parameter order reversed?)
X	35 add about pop up
X	36 Have *includes screens support adding/removing multiple entries
X	54 revert device type drop down on ext form to use device_types table temporarily 
		(not yet an enum type)
XJ	48 maintain grid ordering on refresh
XJ	55 pull current git revision number into about box on compile
		new perl script that uses git so should work on other projects/platforms

move MainForm into Lib assembly?


ext details: 
	1. make sure yes/no on voice mail option reloads vmail grid (using changeTable)
		-talk to mark about how to change this value using DB
		- fixed on db end now?
	2. don't change table if same as previous table?
	3. make 1 and 2 work together. special reload keyword?

TableForm:
	ask Mark: when inserting into some views, like v_phonegroups, do i really have to specify an id?
	- fixed on db now?

- more exception handling especially connection issues and db errors
- also: stacktraces in log? add formating to sql queries so they look nicer in log?
- unit testing!
- implement DBHelper.getColumns? -- get multiple rows and columns? -- probably not needed

done
-----
new TabSetManager class
new TabManager class
multiple simultaneous connections

Connection manager:
	move static helper methods into new StaticHelper class
	move connection manager code into new class

-Connection Manager! (with new PopupQuery class)

-make tabs very smart tabs

-multiColumnCobmboBox: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/combobox/multicolumncombo.aspx: use for uid selectors to give longname etc.
	-working multicolumcombo added to trunkdetails subform and using our data.
			done: in trunk details, pass in visibleColumns so mcc items are ordered
			done: fix bug where mcc list is reloaded and mcc is droped down (renaim unique key)
			done: add it to others subforms: extd
			done: add it to others subforms: tgi, ext, cosi

-add db custom type comboboxes to TableForms' grids

Sheet from Mark; new Forms:
	- Routes
		- Phone Groups
	- Registrations: SIP
	- Registrations: IAX
	- Trunk Groups
	- Feature Codes
	- Trunk Group Includes
	
-investigate switching from odbc.net to
	npgsql.projects.postgresql.org (added npgsql support to DBHelper, and made it the default.
-DBHelper.getMultiple
-convert nvgrid.refresh to use getMultiple instead of getSingle

convert ext details to nvgrids
add vmail nvgrid to ext details

use iax option grid data when appropriate (trunkdetails)
sip scrolling nvgrid; autopopulated
implement types for combobox dropdowns
db getvalidvaluesforcolumn function
namevalue grid objectgot it down to one 
Trunkdetails moved to nvgrid
doxygen, document - done, continue to document new code as it is written
log4net - done, continue to add more logging calls

for mark
--------
- (last tested 1-11-2009) when creating a new v_trunk, callerid_name not saved, unless an update on callerid_name is made afterwards.
eg, below sql does not save "mikej abc"
INSERT INTO Asterisk.v_trunks (trunk_name, trunk_longname, capacity, device_type, callerid_name ) VALUES ( 'new', 'Branch 2', '2', 'SIP', 'mikej abc' )
