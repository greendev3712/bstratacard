Trace viewer
--
- a new tree item in the configurator
- dual pane like an email viewer, the top pane is a scrollable listbox with the columns: 
	timestamp, channel, and message
	
- bottom pane would load information about that timestamped item.. 
	so it would pull from a hash object, and output all the data from the hash as text
	
- the top listbox would have filtering options, so you could filter on a channel substring, 
	or something within the message
	
- see trace_viewer.png

- data comes from json stream not dataset or log
	(maintaining a connection with ami server and will be notified of events)

- Realtime stuff comes from events, historic stuff comes from log file on server
	- both in json

- figuring out the overlap should be easy, all the calls have a uniqueid
	if you connect to the ami first, and start getting events, 
	and then get the log, you shouldnt have any gaps either
	
How does user specify connection details for ami and url for log? (from DB)
